# KingdomMaps (Django rewrite!)
Official repo for KingdomMaps, an interactive timeline on the world.

## Deployment
Prerequisites:
* GNU/Linux distribution (Note: may work on other OS's provided docker and docker-compose are installed, I haven't tested yet)
* Recent, stable version of docker
* Recent, stable version of docker-compose

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd KingdomMaps`
3. `docker-compose build`
4. `docker-compose run`

It's easy as that!
